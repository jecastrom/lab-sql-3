== Lab | Description:
In this lab, you will be using the Sakila database of movie rentals. You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official installation link.

The database is structured as follows:
PICTURE



=== How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
=== In how many different languages where the films originally produced? (Use the column language_id from the film table)
=== How many movies were released with "PG-13" rating?
=== Get 10 the longest movies from 2006.
=== How many days has been the company operating (check DATEDIFF() function)?
=== Show rental info with additional columns month and weekday. Get 20.
=== Add an additional column day_type with values 'weekend' and 'workday' depending on the rental day of the week.
=== How many rentals were in the last month of activity?
