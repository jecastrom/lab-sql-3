== Lab | Description:
In this lab, you will be using the Sakila database of movie rentals. You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official installation link.

The database is structured as follows:

=== How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
```sql
SELECT
    count(DISTINCT last_name)
FROM
    actor;
```

=== In how many different languages where the films originally produced? (Use the column language_id from the film table)

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT language_id
FROM
    film;
```


=== How many movies were released with "PG-13" rating?

```sql
SELECT
    count(DISTINCT rating)
FROM
    film
WHERE
    rating = 'PG-13';
```


=== Get 10 the longest movies from 2006.

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    film
WHERE
    release_year = 2006
ORDER BY
    LENGTH DESC
LIMIT
    10;
```



=== How many days has been the company operating (check DATEDIFF() function)?

```sql
SELECT
    datediff(NOW(), (min(rental_date)))
FROM
    rental;
```
`The result is 6049 days in operation`

[NOTE]
====
To express the same result in years:
 
Using the `timestamdiff()` function which give us an extra argument to format
the result either in `month`, `years`, `days`.

====
```sql
SELECT
    timestampdiff(YEAR, (min(rental_date)), NOW()) AS Time_in_operations
FROM
    rental;
```
[NOTE]
====
 To express the dame result in years and month:
 
 To obtain the year, I calculate the time period with timestampdiff in months,
 using the `floor()` function, will make the result to go to the lowest integer.
 
 `floor(timestampdiff(MONTH, (min(rental_date)), now()) / 12)`
 
 To calculate the months, I use the same operation but this time using the `MOD()` function, which will multiply only the reminder or the decimal part of the calculation, which is a decimal of months `(0.5 month)`. On the second argument of the `MOD()` function I use 12 so `MOD()` can multiply the decimal reminder by 12, as 0.5 years * 12 is 6 months
 
 `mod(timestampdiff(MONTH, (min(rental_date)), now()), 12)`
====

```sql
SELECT
    CONCAT(
        floor(
            timestampdiff(MONTH, (min(rental_date)), NOW()) / 12
        ),
        ' Years ',
        mod(
            timestampdiff(MONTH, (min(rental_date)), NOW()),
            12
        ),
        ' Month'
    ) AS No_of_years_month_in_operation
FROM
    rental;
```


=== Show rental info with additional columns month and weekday. Get 20.

I have chosen date_format() function as it gives me more fredom on the date format I want.
The extract() function only extracts the numerical values of the date.

```sql
 SELECT
    *,
    date_format(rental_date, '%M') AS month_,
    date_format(rental_date, '%W') AS weekday
FROM
    rental
LIMIT
    20;
```

=== Add an additional column day_type with values 'weekend' and 'workday' depending on the rental day of the week.

```sql
SELECT
    *,
    CASE
        WHEN week_day_index BETWEEN 2
        AND 6 THEN 'Workday'
        ELSE 'Weekend'
    END AS day_type
FROM
    rental,
    (
        SELECT
            dayofweek(rental_date) AS week_day_index
        FROM
            rental
    ) AS t_temp
LIMIT
    10;
```

=== How many rentals were in the last month of activity?

There were 182 rentals
I found best to do a subquery as the WHRER clause does not 
allow to filter `(max(rental_date))`

```sql
SELECT
    count(*)
FROM
    rental
WHERE
    rental_date = (
        SELECT
            max(rental_date)
        FROM
            rental
    );
```
